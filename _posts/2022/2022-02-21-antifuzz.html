    Fuzzing is one of the most widely used and successful methods of finding
    security vulnerabilities in software programs. Fuzzing tools automatically
    and randomly generates input to a program, and run the program using these
    inputs until it crashes. These crashes usually indicate the presence
    of a security vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker.
  </p>
  <p>
    But fuzzing can also be used by attackers who want to exploit the program.
    Can we therefore make our program difficult to
    fuzz so an attacker can not detect any hidden vulnerability in our program?
    To find out,
    the authors of this paper developed strategies that make fuzzing a
    program difficult. They identified some assumptions that existing
    fuzzing tools depend on to work successfully then developed a tool,
    AntiFuzz, that can be used to modify the target program and impede fuzzing.
    Some assumptions and counter-measures include:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Fuzzers try to generate inputs that can transverse all parts of the program code
        using coverage information. Hence, if we can make our program return false coverage information,
        fuzzing would be significantly impeded. To achieve this, AntiFuzz returns
        different, fake coverage information for each input to the program.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Fuzzers monitor the operating system in order to detect program crashes. To counter
        this, AntiFuzz sends fake crash signals to the operating systems.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Fuzzers need to execute the program many times per second in order to operate
        efficiently. Since most of the input generated by the fuzzers is
        malformed, AntiFuzz slows the program down when it detects such inputs.
	While this slowdown would not be noticed
        by a normal user, it can significantly impede the efficient operation of the fuzzer.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    To see if their approach actually worked, the authors used four different state-of-the-art
    fuzzers to fuzz a set of target programs which contained several bugs. Their results
    show that AntiFuzz successfully prevented the detection of all bugs previously
    detected when all the counter-measures were applied.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love their approach to impeding fuzzing because it combines multiple measures.
    However, by making the publicly deployed
    and accessible version of a program resistant to fuzzing, this would restrict the
    fuzzing operation to only the program developers, impeding the detection of security
    vulnerabilities by security researchers and white hat hackers who also rely on fuzzing.

    A general defense strategy in computer security is to increase the cost of
    successful attacks in both computational resources as well as human time.
    In the area of binary security, this is commonly done by using obfuscation
    methods to hinder reverse engineering and the search for software vulnerabilities.
    However, recent trends in automated bug finding changed the modus operandi.
    Nowadays it is very common for bugs to be found by various fuzzing tools.
    Due to ever-increasing amounts of automation and research on better fuzzing
    strategies, large-scale, dragnet-style fuzzing of many hundreds of targets
    becomes viable. As we show, current obfuscation techniques are aimed at
    increasing the cost of human understanding and do little to slow down fuzzing.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this paper, we introduce several techniques to protect a binary executable
    against an analysis with automated bug f inding approaches that are based on
    fuzzing, symbolic/concolic execution, and taint-assisted fuzzing (commonly
    known as hybrid fuzzing). More specifically, we perform a systematic analysis
    of the fundamental assumptions of bug finding tools and develop general
    countermeasures for each assumption. Note that these techniques are not
    designed to target specific implementations of fuzzing tools, but address
    general assumptions that bug finding tools necessarily depend on. Our
    evaluation demonstrates that these techniques effectively impede fuzzing
    audits, while introducing a negligible performance overhead. Just as
    obfuscation techniques increase the amount of human labor needed to find
    a vulnerability, our techniques render automated fuzzing-based approaches futile.
